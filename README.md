# Game Description
Hello, this game is about a humanoid robot.
The robot has 4 attributes.
1. Happiness
2. Hygiene
3. Health
4. Hunger
The game will be over if the robot dies. The robot will die if these 4 attributes dropped into 0 or less.

The robot also has 2 stats.
1. Money
2. Social Point/Score
Money just act as its name. The robot will not die if money goes below 0, but you will be limited to do some actions because the robot needs some money to do so.
Social Point act as score, the goal is to get the highest score.
The robot will eventually dead because we make it so. *evil laugh*

The gameplay is so simple. You just type the number to control the robot.
Every 5 rounds, a random event will show, you can take/decline the event.
The event can bring you advantage or disadvantage, it based on chance.

The game is full of random number generator, so have fun :)
